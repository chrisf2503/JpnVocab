Lesson1 : Passive Sentence
At some point in our lives had something done to us where it’s displeasing and dis-satisfying such that we are not happy on the end result.

たとえば：
友達が車を使いました							 A friend used my car.
私は友達に車を使われました					         I had my car used by my friend. 
(and I am mad/sad about it)
Comparing the two sentence, we can see that the first one is just saying that a friend just used my car. Showing somewhat of a neutral feeling about it. But the second shows that a friend used my car (probably without permission), therefore I am upset that he did such an act.
