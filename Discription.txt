For this project, I want to be able to make a list of japanese vocab word and 
be able to print both in japanese(kanji, hiragana) and the english definition

Therefore we want a type of list call that will store these definition and do 
the following
1. being able to choose a word at random
2. storing new vocab that is not in the list
3. having different type of modes (translating english to japanese and vis versa)
4. having a user input to see if the vocab is in or not
5. try to give an example on how it is being used 

Current Objective:
    Now we want to let user choose the following modes (study,review,new);
Therefore within our main method we want to make these 3 new function. 

void study();
void review();
void newCard();
